ex. calculator.sum.call(multilingualMessages, 1, 2)
apply: a method on a function, just like ().  The first argument called thisArg, is the object that should be used as the value of this when the function is invoked.You then pass additional arguments you want to send to the function as an array after thisArg. 
ex. calculator.sum.apply(multilingualMessages, [1, 2])
bind: method returns a copy of the function its called on, but with the execution context "set" to the arguments thats passed to bind
